#Introduction
For our project, our main goal was to predict the number of EV charging stations that a location should have based on population, income and other factors. Although EVs and plug in hybrid light-duty vehicle registrations only made up 1.2% of the total U.S. market share, the market size is rapidly growing. The U.S. EV market size was valued at 24.03 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow by 471%, to 137.43 billion in 2023. The EV market is also growing globally- EV sales increased by 39% between 2022 and 2023, making up 18% of the total global market in 2023. The U.S. holds status as the third-largest EV manufacturer in the world. With the potential downstream profits that EV chargers can bring to a town or city in the U.S., we aimed to predict the number of EV charging stations a city should have based on population, median income of working adults, etc. Local & national governments can utilize this information to inform public policy and support the infrastructure of building more stations in order to support sustainability efforts, creation of new technologies, better meet consumer demand as well as drive local profits in terms of job creation, etc.  

#Methods
We used Jupyter notebook to conduct data cleaning of data from various online sources, including The United States Census Bureau. We used Scikit-learn to create various prediction models in order to find the best fit such as linear regression, random forest and a neural network model. We created a Flask site to interact with the model in addition to charts and maps in Tableau, embedded into the site. We ran into several challenges when searching for data to support our goal, cleaning downloaded table data from the Census bureau, gathering sufficient and accurate data for our model.
